Loan Approval Prediction (Decision Trees)

**Description**  
A Decision Tree model to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details from the Kaggle Loan Prediction dataset. This project explains how decision trees split data using information gain and Gini impurity.

**Key Features**
- Handling missing values and encoding categorical features  
- Visualization of decision tree structure  
- Explanation of entropy, Gini index, and tree splitting criteria  
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance  

**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Graphviz  
**Dataset:** [Kaggle Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication)
